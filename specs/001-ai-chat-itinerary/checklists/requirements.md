# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Chat-Based Itinerary Creation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Check
✅ **PASS** - Specification is written in user-centric, non-technical language
- User stories describe user journeys and value, not technical implementation
- Requirements focus on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- Success criteria are measurable user outcomes

### Requirement Completeness Check
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each functional requirement is specific and testable
- Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tech stack)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- Edge cases cover error scenarios, boundary conditions, and unusual inputs
- Assumptions clearly documented for context

### Feature Readiness Check
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase
- 4 user stories prioritized from P1 (MVP) to P4
- Each story independently testable and deliverable
- 20 functional requirements covering all aspects of the feature
- 10 measurable success criteria with clear metrics
- 6 key entities identified
- 8 edge cases documented

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories enables incremental delivery
- Comprehensive functional requirements cover all aspects of the conversational itinerary creation flow
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Assumptions provide important context for implementation decisions
- Edge cases anticipate real-world scenarios

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` can now be executed to create the implementation plan.
